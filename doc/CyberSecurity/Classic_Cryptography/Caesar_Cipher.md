# Caesar Cipher

## Overview
Students will explore encoding/decoding messages using the Caesar Cipher. Using a cipher wheel, messages will be encoded and decoded.

## Purpose
The Caesar Cipher is one of the best known forms of encryption.  This signifies a change from encoding where a message was hidden with a set of substitutions for each letter to one where the only knowledge needed is a key to "unlock" the message.

### Objectives
#### Students will be able to:
- Encode/Decode a message using a Caesar Cipher and a known key
- Begin to decode messages where the key is unknown using cryptanalysis

### Preparation
- [x] Print the [Caesar Cipher wheel](Caesar_Cipher/Papercraft_Caesar_Wheel.docx) on cardstock
- [x] Get brad fasteners
- [x] Print [Caesar Cipher Worksheet](Caesar_Cipher/Caesar_Cipher_Activity.docx)
- [x] Download [CaesarCipher.py](code/CaesarCipher.py) python file.

### Vocabulary
Plaintext - a message or text that can be read normally
Ciphertext - a message that has been encrypted so it is not readable in current form.
Encode - the act of converting plaintext to ciphertext
Decode - the act of converting ciphertext to plaintext

## Teaching Guide
### Getting Started
- Overview of Caesar Cipher (video)		
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMOZf4GN3oc

### Activity:
Paper craft Caesar Cipher wheel
- Have students cut out and assemble the paper cipher wheel.
- Students will work through the encryption process on the worksheet.
- Students can engage with the CryptoClub Desert Oasis game.

### Activity (coding):
Look at the CaesarCipher.py Python file.
- The program is setup to accept a message
- The message can be encoded using a Caesar Shift
- Have students finish the decode method to convert ciphertext to plaintext.

### Wrap-up
#### Discussion:
1. How many possible keys are there in a Caesar Cipher?
1. What level of security does this provide us?  How difficult is it to break a message encrypted using the Caesar Cipher?

1. TED Talk: [Why Privacy Matters](https://www.ted.com/talks/alessandro_acquisti_why_privacy_matters?language=en)

### Assessment Questions
- How have computers changed the security of a cipher like this one?
- Create a Caesar Cipher where the key changes for each word or letter.
	- What would the rules of this cipher be?
	- How would you encode / decode this message?
	- What would you need to know to decode this message?
	- How does this change the security of the cipher?

Programming: Bruteforce Caesar Decode
- Using the decode method written in the programming activity, create a program that decodes using all 25 possible Caesar shifts.
