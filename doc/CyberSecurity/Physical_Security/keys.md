# Keys & Locks

## Overview
Locking the door is one of the easiest methods of securing our house, offices, and other important spaces.  Standard locks are vulnerable to attack from lock picking or more crude methods of breaking in.  In addition to securing computer systems digitally, students should consider how computers are physically secured.

## Purpose
Understand locks as systems and understand how they work to understand how they might be exploited.  This is another analogy to computing systems in finding potential vulnerably by understanding the way the underlying system works.

### Objectives
#### Students will be able to:
- Understand the vulnerabilities of a standard lock set.
- Identify additional security measures to secure a room or building.

	- https://github.com/deviantollam/decoding
- Using those overlays and a photo editor, try to work out the pin settings for a key with only a photo.
	- Examples in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AayXf5aRFTI starting at around 13:00.

- Example key images
	- [key1.jpg](Key_Images/key1.jpg)
