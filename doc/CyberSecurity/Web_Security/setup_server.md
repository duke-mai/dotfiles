# Setup Remote Server
## Overview
We will be working on a server for HTML development. This will allow us to create pages that can be shown to others and we have the benefit of a full server. This also allows for server-side functions like PHP and SQL.

## Purpose
Use a development environment, to host a web site and begin engaging with some of the server-side elements of a web site.

### Objectives
#### Students will be able to:
- Create a project in on a remote server
- Upload a local web site to the server

### Preparation
- [x] Examine several server options and determine what works best for your context.

- [x] Setup C9 account and give students access to your "team"
